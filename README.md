# NASA-Space-Apps-Cairo-Hackathon
NASA’s space missions have discovered thousands of exoplanets, mostly through manual identification. With AI/ML, vast datasets from these missions can be analyzed automatically. The challenge is to build a model trained on NASA’s open-source exoplanet data to detect new planets with high accuracy.
